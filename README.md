# Owl Smart Levels MT5

## Product Description
Owl Smart Levels MT5 is a simplified forex trading tool that provides trading signals based on multiple indicators. This code demonstrates how the Owl Smart Levels MT5 works by initializing three indicators and checking for trading signals. 

When all three indicators generate a signal, the code places a buy order if all signal types are 'BUY', and a sell order if all signal types are 'SELL'. The code also includes functions to check for trade exit conditions and close the trade if necessary.
